1.DOTA Maximizer:
You are a DOTA player. You want to win without accidence. Here is a problem you may
want to solve.
Let's assume:
    (1). Money unit in DOTA is D, just like $ in North America;
    (2). Price of equipment: 100*POWER(2, i)D, i = 0, 1, 2, ...;
    (3). Yield: POWER(4, i)D/minute, i = 0, 1, 2, ....

Rules are:
    (1). You can only get half of the initial price of money back by selling a equipment. You 
    cannot get money back if the initial price is 1. 
    (2). All transaction must happen at integral minute.

Q1: Given the money you have initially. Please calculate the yield rate. You are not allowed 
to change equiments during the game. 
Q2: Initially you have 625D. You are allowed to buy new equipments as well as sell existing
equiments. Please calculate the maximized total assets = money left + Sum(initial price each
equipment) when the game ends. 
Q3: Follow Q2, what if there's a upper limit (e.g. 6) of the equipments you could hold.
